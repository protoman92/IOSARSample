# IOSARSample

Sample app to experiment with ARKit. This app only shows on screen where a target location is, relative to current location.

To run this app:
- Clone this repository.
- Run `pod update` in the repository folder.
- Run the app - you will see a screen with two text fields to search for origin/destination.
- Click on visualize to start routing - the AR screen will popup and route instructions will appear every few seconds.
