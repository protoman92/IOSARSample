# IOSARSample

Sample app to experiment with ARKit. This app only shows on screen where a target location is, relative to current location.

To run this app:
- Clone this repository.
- Run `pod update` in the repository folder.
- Run the app - you will see a screen with two text fields to search for origin/destination.
- Click on visualize to start routing - the AR screen will popup. Follow instructions on screen.

The routing API uses a token that expires every three days. [Please follow this guide to get a new token](https://discuss.onemap.sg/t/steps-for-api-authentication/59).
